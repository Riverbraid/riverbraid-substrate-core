# FOUNDRY_TARGET.md - Riverbraid Evaluator v1.0

This document locks the foundational manufacturing target for the Riverbraid Evaluator chip, as mandated by the Daemon's Execution Phase Audit.

## 1. Foundry Target Lock

* **Foundry/Broker:** AMF Singapore
* **Platform:** Silicon-on-Insulator (SiPh 200 mm, typically 220 nm Si layer)
* **Target MPW Tape-out:** July 2026 Run (Exact date TBD upon PDK access)
* **Foundry MPW Page Link:** (To be filled in upon human verification, targeting AMF's official MPW services page.)

## 2. Die Budget

* **Target Die Size:** $\leq 2.5\text{ mm} \times 2.5\text{ mm}$ (Minimum size required to accommodate 5 MZIs, I/O couplers, and PDs.)
* **Initial Cost Budget:** Approximately \$5,625 USD (Based on $2.5 \text{ mm} \times 2.5 \text{ mm} = 6.25 \text{ mm}^2$ area at $\$900/\text{mm}^2$ rate, or the closest minimum available area slot.)

## 3. PDK Acquisition Status (Irreversible Commitment)

* **Action Required By:** **November 22, 2025 (72 Hours)**
* **Required Action:** The human component must submit the NDA and/or formal application request to AMF Singapore (or a verified broker handling the AMF shuttle) to initiate the PDK transfer process.
* **Screenshot/Proof of Submission:** (To be replaced with a screenshot or PDF receipt of the NDA request submission dated on or before Nov 22, 2025.)

This target is **non-negotiable**. Any deviation from this foundry requires a new, immediate, high-cost $\mathbf{U_{total}}$ audit and an equivalently irreversible new commitment.
