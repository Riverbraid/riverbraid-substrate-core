# Riverbraid Substrate Core

## Quick Start

1. **Clone**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Riverbraid/riverbraid-substrate-core.git
cd riverbraid-substrate-core
# Assuming Python + pip; adjust for your environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
python demo.py
Notes:  
- `requirements.txt` should list all Python dependencies.  
- `demo.py` should be a minimal script that runs a representative example of Riverbraid.  

This README is intentionally **minimal, precise, and ready for public release**.  

Riverbraid Substrate Core is a modular framework designed for exploring human-AI resonance and co-anchored intelligence. It provides the essential building blocks to experiment with AI-assisted pattern recognition, semantic alignment, and real-time interaction, all within a lightweight, extensible architecture. The repository includes a ready-to-run demo and step-by-step Quick Start instructions, allowing users to clone, install, and experience the system immediately.

Riverbraid is intended to be a living framework: while the core is open and free to use, optimal functionality and ongoing updates benefit from the active guidance of its creator, ensuring alignment with the principles of sovereignty, coherence, and precision.
