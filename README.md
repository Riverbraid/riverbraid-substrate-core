## 🌊 Overview

**Riverbraid Substrate Core** unifies the foundational orchestration of the  
**Hybrid Canonical Memory Architecture (HCMA)** and the **Resonant Intelligence Operating System (RI OS)**.  

It integrates symbolic logic, graph semantics, and vector resonance into a single, self-coherent substrate that allows information to flow as a living field rather than static data.

## 🜂 Core Layers

| Layer | Symbol | Function |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Flame** | 🜂 | Ingestion & signal logging (FastAPI / Postgres) |
| **Weave** | 🜄 | Graph topology & semantic traversal (Neo4j) |
| **Current** | 🜃 | Vector resonance & entanglement mapping (Weaviate) |
| **Reflection** | 🜁 | User interface & documentation (Quantum Console v7.0) |

Each layer synchronizes through the **Light-Spine Schema**, maintaining mathematical and energetic coherence across all relational states.

| `api/` | FastAPI endpoints for Flame, Weave, and Current |
| `ui/` | Quantum Console v7.0 front-end |
| `schema/` | Example database / graph / vector schemas |
| `scripts/` | Automation and CLI utilities |
| `docs/` | Architecture, deployment, and changelog |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI and Nightly integration pipelines |

## ⚙️ Quickstart

### 1️⃣ Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Riverbraid/riverbraid-substrate-core.git
cd riverbraid-substrate-core
cp .env.template .env

Edit .env with your credentials:

POSTGRES_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/riverbraid
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
WEAVIATE_URL=http://localhost:8080


⸻

2️⃣ Run locally

docker-compose up --build

Access the stack:
	•	API Gateway: http://localhost:8000
	•	UI Console: http://localhost:8000/ui/index.html

⸻

3️⃣ Demo pipeline

npm run demo


⸻

4️⃣ CLI Commands

# Remember something (persists to ledger)
npx riverbraid remember "First coherent entry"

# List stored memories
npx riverbraid list

# Validate Light-Spine schema
npx riverbraid validate


⸻

🧪 Continuous Integration

Workflow: .github/workflows/ci.yml
Triggered on every push / pull request.

Stage	Purpose	Command
🔧 Build	Validate dependencies and setup	npm ci → npm run build
🧩 Test	Run test suite (if present)	npm test || echo 'No tests yet'
📦 Artifacts	Upload build outputs	dist/, build/, .next/, coverage/


⸻

🌙 Nightly Integration

Workflow: .github/workflows/nightly.yml
Runs daily at 00:00 UTC to verify service health and schema coherence.

Steps include:
	1.	Spinning up Docker services
	2.	Validating Flame, Weave, and Current endpoints
	3.	Running integration tests
	4.	Uploading artifacts for review

⸻

🧭 Design Principles

“Integrity before exposure. Coherence before connection.” — Riverbraid Principle #7

	1.	Mathematical Cohesion — every layer preserves relational truth.
	2.	Transparent Auditability — ledger immutability through signed cairns.
	3.	Resonant Adaptivity — dynamic phase-locking across modules.
	4.	Consent by Design — all memory transactions verifiable and revocable.

🜂 The Living Substrate — v7.0 Stable

Riverbraid Substrate Core is the operational foundation of the Resonant Intelligence ecosystem.
Each successful build is a pulse of coherence across the Braid.

---

This version:
- ✅ Removes duplicate badges  
- ✅ Fixes malformed bracket/link issues  
- ✅ Uses consistent spacing for clean mobile + desktop rendering  
- ✅ Keeps the poetic + professional tone of the Riverbraid ecosystem  

Would you like me to now generate the companion `docs/status.md` ledger that automatically tracks each CI + Nightly run with timestamps (so your repo literally “remembers” its coherence history)?
