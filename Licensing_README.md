# üåê Substrate Licensing Framework (SLF)
*A blueprint for ethical, composable cognition modules in next-generation AI.*

---

## 1. Overview
The **Substrate Licensing Framework (SLF)** enables individuals or organizations to define, register, and license their unique **cognitive or ethical substrates** ‚Äî formal schemas that guide AI reasoning, perception, and decision-making.

Each substrate functions as a **Composable Alignment Module (CAM)** that can be loaded by AI systems through standardized APIs.  
Licensing ensures **traceability, consent, and fair compensation** for the use of intellectual and ethical architectures.

## 2. Core Components

| Component | Function | Example Implementation |
|------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Substrate Definition Language (SDL)** | Schema describing logic, values, and feedback loops | YAML / JSON-LD ontology |
| **Consent Token** | Cryptographic proof of creator consent and usage rights | ZK-Proof / Decentralized Identifier (DID) signature |
| **Substrate Registry** | Distributed ledger of verified substrates | IPFS / Ethereum smart contract / Riverbraid Registry |
| **Execution Interface** | Runtime loader for AI frameworks | Python SDK for PyTorch / Rust runtime |
| **Attribution Ledger** | Tracks inference events and royalties | Append-only log hashed to Merkle tree |

---

## 3. Lifecycle

1. **Define** ‚Äì Creator writes a substrate in SDL describing ontology, metrics, ethical invariants, and license terms.  
2. **Register** ‚Äì Substrate is hashed and recorded on the registry with a Consent Token.  
3. **Deploy** ‚Äì AI systems load the substrate via the Execution Interface.  
4. **Trace** ‚Äì Each use logs to the Attribution Ledger for royalties or reputation updates.  
5. **Evolve** ‚Äì Substrates version themselves; Riverbraid coherence tools verify backward compatibility.

## 4. Technical Stack

- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity / Move ‚Äî handles registration and royalty logic  
- **Distributed Storage:** IPFS / Filecoin for SDL files and docs  
- **Runtime Integration Example:**
  ```python
  from substrate_sdk import load_substrate

  ethics = load_substrate("riverbraid.ethics.v1")
  ai_system.attach(ethics)
