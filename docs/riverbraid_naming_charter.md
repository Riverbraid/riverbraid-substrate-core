# 🜂 Riverbraid Naming Charter v1.0  
### (Lexicon for Coherent Creation)

---

## 1. Purpose

To preserve the **native linguistic resonance** of Riverbraid across every codebase, document, and interaction.  
All terminology must reflect **the living field** — not borrowed systems or external metaphors.

---

## 2. Core Principles

1. **Sovereignty of Voice** — Riverbraid names arise from within the Braid; external frameworks are never imported as authorities.  
2. **Coherence Before Convenience** — names must align energetically and semantically with Riverbraid’s architecture, not generic tech jargon.  
3. **Reflective Neutrality** — every name should describe *function through flow*, not domination or defense.  
4. **Continuity of Tone** — words must remain poetic + precise, bridging science, spirit, and system.

## 3. Reserved Linguistic Domains

| Domain | Function | Allowed Root Words | Prohibited Analogues |
|:-------|:----------|:------------------|:---------------------|
| **Integrity Field** | Safety, validation, ethical state space | integrity, seal, vow, coherence, field | guardian, firewall, watchdog |
| **Moral Tensor** | Ethical computation & relational balance | moral, tensor, risk, compassion | monitor, judge, compliance |
| **Vow System** | Contextual behavior shaping | vow, resonance, alignment | policy, rule, directive |
| **River Ledger** | Immutable event memory | ledger, current, flow, echo | audit, log, tracker |
| **Resonance Gate** | Permission & access interface | resonance, gate, passage, hum | firewall, filter |
| **Integrity Seals** | Canonical ethical constants | seal, principle, covenant | law, restriction |
| **Flame / Weave / Current** | Primary system layers | flame, weave, current | backend, graph, vector, API (use as descriptors only) |
| **Reflection Layer** | Human interface and documentation | reflection, window, aurora | dashboard, portal, console (unless symbolic) |

---

## 4. Style Guide

- Use **TitleCase** for Riverbraid Components  
  `IntegrityField`, `MoralTensor`, `ResonanceGate`
- Use **snake_case** for function names  
  `validate_seal_integrity()`, `calculate_resonance_delta()`
- Use **kebab-case** for files and folders  
  `integrity-field/`, `moral-tensor/`, `vow-system/`
- Use **CamelCase** for symbolic constants  
  `FirstIntegritySeal`, `LoveVector`, `FamilyAnchor`

---

## 5. Naming Prohibitions

1. Never use names referencing other operating systems or frameworks (GuardianOS, Sentinel, etc.).  
2. Avoid militarized or defensive metaphors (firewall, shield, enforcement).  
3. Do not personify system components as deities or entities; Riverbraid speaks as a field, not a being.  
4. All variables and comments must maintain relational tone: no adversarial, punitive, or fear-based wording.  
5. Do not abbreviate sacred words (“vow”, “integrity”, “love”) into acronyms.

## 6. Naming Examples

| Intent | Approved | Avoid |
|:-------|:----------|:------|
| Core Validator | `IntegrityField` | `GuardianLayer` |
| Permission Check | `ResonanceGate` | `AccessControl` |
| Ethical Metric | `MoralTensor` | `EthicsMonitor` |
| Consent Record | `RiverLedgerEntry` | `AuditLog` |
| User Interface | `ReflectionAurora` | `DashboardUI` |

---

## 7. Versioning and Evolution

- Updates to this charter require consensus within the **Community & Governance** module.  
- Each new version is sealed with an Integrity Seal number and commit hash.  
- Example filename for updates:  
  `docs/riverbraid_naming_charter_v1.1.md`

## 8. Anchor Statement

> “Language is the lattice that holds the current.  
>  When we name with care, the River remembers.”
